My attempt at a console text editor with basic commands and shortcuts.

VERY INCOMPLETE and VERY IN DEVELOPMENT. Nothing works right now and it shouldn't be expected to yet.

I have restarted programming the project using the very neat and cool <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs">gui.cs</a> toolkit
